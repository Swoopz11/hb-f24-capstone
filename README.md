## My Fake Dating App

I have made a fake dating website exclusively for my younger brother who is currently out of the country. This is entirely for laughs at his expense. Everything in my app is in no way a reflection of reality. 

The features in my app include an option for visitors to add their name to a waiting list along with a photo of their choice, they may also remove themselves and others from that list. On a separate page visitors are able to add date locations that they are interested in or remove date locations as well.

This app was coded in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The app utilizes node.js, express, cors and axios. The html documentation contains the layout of my three web pages. I have made custom designs using css for my app. The rest of the front end was written in JavaScript to handle my controller functions from my backend files. The backend was also written in JavaScript, which is comprised of two controller files, an index file and two JSON data files. The index files house the epxress and cors requirements as well as my controller functions and endpoints. The two controller files hande functions for the date locations and waitlist respectively.
